<strong>Jason Polhemus</strong>. (That's\n        me up there, all bearded and upside-down. Adorable.) I previously lived\n        in Atlanta, where I held down two jobs (one I currently hold), the first\n        of which is both <strong>sound engineer</strong> and{' '}\n        <strong>sound designer</strong> for theaters around town. The second job\n        was <strong>electrical engineer</strong> at a company building 3-D\n        printers and accessories.{' '}\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {' '}\n        At first they may seem pretty different, but they both involve\n        constructing systems that allow information to pass through, processing\n        that information in some way, and achieving an aesthetic output. For the\n        printing, I, as the engineer, have to worry about every phase of the\n        print, making sure that the settings are holding, and that the print is\n        otherwise succeeding. And there's a tangible output: the printed part.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {' '}\n        For the sound engineering, the output happens simultaneously with the\n        creation at every phase of the production, and the output is a little\n        more intangible (enjoyment? excitement? thoughtfulness?). Both then\n        break down into a series of smaller systems that direct the flow of\n        information (frequency, or motor controls) from an input (microphone, or\n        console buttons), through a processing step, to an output. At a higher\n        level, the processing step breaks down into smaller tasks affecting the\n        flow of information according to a design.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {' '}\n        I've spent the past several years learning and practicing programming,\n        specifically the functional paradigm, and I began to see the same\n        pattern in the idea of small functions that compose to make more complex\n        behavior, etc. Here we seem to take an input (user info, a file, etc),\n        process it, and output it (another file, the screen, etc.). Seems very\n        similar to input (microphone), processing (EQ, compression, etc), and\n        output (speakers). Or even input (control panel buttons/tablet\n        interface), processing (split signal to different sub-systems, etc), to\n        output (3-D printed object). It's this pattern that I hope to explore\n        more, though it's led to some pretty harsh thickets, like category\n        theory, process philosophy, and GCODE.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Update: My wife and I have moved up to Chicago, IL from Atlanta, GA. I\n        am actively seeking to transition to programming full-time. Fingers\n        crossed; I'm pretty excited about the possibilities. If you like what\n        you see here (or think I'm a pretty cool guy), and know of a gig in the\n        Chicago area (or remote), email me and let me know. Or just say hi!
